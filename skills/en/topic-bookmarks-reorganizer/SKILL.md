# Topic Bookmarks Reorganizer

Reorganize one topic folder from a browser bookmarks export into a cleaner importable file.

## When to Use

Use this skill when the user asks for one or more of these tasks:
- Analyze one bookmarks export file and find a user-specified topic folder
- Re-classify links and subfolders under that topic
- Remove duplicate links by URL
- Output a new HTML file that can be imported into a browser
- Keep only the target topic folder in the output

## Do not use

Do not use this skill when:
- The input is not a bookmarks export HTML file
- The user only wants manual writing help with no file processing
- The user asks for unrelated JSON/PDF/Docx transformations

## Instructions

1. Ask for required input:
- Export file path
- Target topic folder name
- Output file path

2. Run the script in report mode first:

```bash
python3 scripts/reorganize_topic_bookmarks.py \
  --input /path/to/bookmarks.html \
  --output /tmp/topic-preview.html \
  --topic-folder "<topic-folder-name>" \
  --mode auto \
  --lang en \
  --report /tmp/topic-report.json \
  --print-report
```

3. Confirm final options with user only if needed:
- `--mode auto` for automatic strategy selection
- `--mode generic` for generic strategy
- `--no-dedupe-url` to keep duplicate URLs

4. Generate final output:

```bash
python3 scripts/reorganize_topic_bookmarks.py \
  --input /path/to/bookmarks.html \
  --output /path/to/topic-bookmarks-reorganized.html \
  --topic-folder "<topic-folder-name>" \
  --mode auto \
  --lang en
```

5. Validate and report:
- Confirm output file exists
- Report input links, output links, and removed duplicate count
- Confirm output contains exactly one top-level folder: the target topic

## Output Expectations

- Output format is Netscape bookmarks HTML and is browser-importable
- Output contains only the target topic folder
- Links keep original `<A ...>` attributes (for example add-date/icon)
- Folder structure is reorganized into high-level categories
